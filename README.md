# Intergalactic-Lander-Cheat
Another cheat for a popular skill game on https://www.coolmathgames.com This is another cache save edit cheat. 

That is pretty advanced (So maybe don't try this one if you're a novice user).

Feature List:
- All levels completed
- All levels 3 stars
- All loot collected in all levels
- All ships unlocked
- 1E+54 Lander Crystals
- Darth Vader ship unlocked

*Note: If you collect any Lander Crystal's it will set the value back to 0 instead of adding to your total amount.

This was a pain in the ass to get done. But hey thats what save editing is about right?

Otherwise if you know what you're doing please use this cheat, Customize it for all I care. (Probably nothing to customize though).
